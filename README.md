## Project Description

## Motivation

## A paragraph explaining how your project relates to the topics of parsing, interpretation and compilation
Our Fitness Program DSL project is intimately connected to the fields of parsing, interpretation, and compilation. Parsing plays a pivotal role as it allows our platform to intelligently convert the visually created workout routines—comprising blocks representing exercises, repetitions, and sets—into structured workout plans. The accuracy of this parsing process is paramount in ensuring that users receive the workout routines they intend to create. Subsequently, interpretation and compilation principles come into play as our DSL acts as an interpreter, translating these visual routines into actionable, executable workout programs. This transformation process involves understanding the semantics of each exercise, repetition scheme, and set arrangement to compile them into a coherent and effective workout routine. By adhering to these principles, our project bridges the gap between fitness and programming, offering users a dynamic and interactive platform to create, understand, and execute personalized fitness routines with ease and precision.
